## Vision

**For** data owners, **who** are interested in sharing or selling their data, and \
**for** data users, **who** are interested in reusing data and generating new value from it.

The project **MyData** is a data marketplace \
**that** allows users share and describe datasets (files or streams), define their licensing
terms, search datasets considering their popularity, download or subscribe to a dataset, 
request datasets about a given topic, discuss about a particular dataset or topic, 
flag or block an offending or illegal dataset,...

**Unlike** other data portals and marketplaces, this project considers both data files and 
streams, allows open and closed licensing terms and provides a rich set of community building 
mechanisms arround the data.
